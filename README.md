# PersonDetectandNotify
V2 of the Person Detection py module Ive been working on - see https://github.com/thendawg/tfhumandetectionnotify for previous documention.

More documentation will be added shortly. 

I created a new repo for this as significant changes were made to the previous module such that updating the other git didnt make since.
Everything is ran from a single py, detect.py

I also include service and shell scripts that can be used with a Linux host (py has been tested on both Windows 10 and Linux - Ubuntu 18.04)
Anything you need to config is in config.py
